## Week 2: Change
Change that improves things is necessary to move forward.

### 19 - Change Curve
The "V" impact on productivity and/or attitude which usually follows a change.

#### Key Points
- 4 specific areas
- valley of despair
- up and down pressures along the curve

As a manager, prepare!  Plan, train, communicate (the *why* not just the *how* and *what*).

### 50 - Hawthorne Effect
Temporary improvement in productivity and/or attitude which is a psychological reaction to the change itself

- 1920 Elton Mayo (Harvard Researcher)
- Hawthorne Plant of Western Electric in Cicero, Illinois
- Lights and productivity
- Control group and test group

### 20 - Change Diamond
Four methods of reducing impact of change on individuals

- Short-term/low goals
  - Milestones
  - Schedule
  - Small segments
  - Adds success
- Control the Rate of Change
  - Number of changes
  - Length of implementation
- Form Groups
  - Task force
  - Committees
  - Adds value
  - Give support
- Ceremonialize
  - Kick off meeting
  - Recognition
  - Adds attention

What's the point?  DO THIS.

### 56 - Incrementalism
General approach to implementing change programs of all types

#### Reduced Resistance
- People tend to ressit or be afraid of big changes
- Threshold is about 10%

#### Increased Efficiency
- If we do not resist but accept the changes, we can make progress

What's the point?  DO THIS.

### 98 - Perceptual Fraction
The way an item is viewed depends upon its relation to another item or items

An 8% raise is great until you find out that everyone else is getting a 30% raise.

How you present something affects the way it is perceived.

What's the point?  DO THIS.

### 127 - Slot Machine Management
Style of management characterized by frequent and massive changes

What are you looking for when you play the slot machines?
- Quick return.
- Big payoff.

Problems:
- analysis is difficult
- high cost
- low morale
- poor planning

What's the point?  It's gambling.  Avoid it.

### People Resist Change??
Generally accepted as a truism.
(Truism is a statemet generally accepted without question)

People resist *some* changes
- changes not seen as positive or beneficial
- changes they do not understand
- changes that are out of their control

People resist *being* changed
- cannot change adult personality
- organizational training is polishing versus structural

What's the point?  Can you change people?  Should you try?  NO.

### 47 - Freudian Hydraulic
Psychological pressure results in a change of unknown direction or magnitude

Components
- Freud: father of psycho-analysis
- Hydraulic: little pressure, lots of force

Newton's Third Law
- For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

What's the point?  DON'T DO THIS.  If you apply *psychological* pressure, you will get a reaction of unknown direction and magnitude.

### 87 - North Wind Theory
Resistance can be avoided by creating a desire for the change

Use when you can:
- predict the results
- take time
- plan

### 21 - Change Grid
Nine possible views of an organizational change on B (by both A and B)

A and B need to agree on their view of the change **regardless of whether good, bad, or neutral**

What's the point?  Any change, you need to be in sync.  Align your expectations.
