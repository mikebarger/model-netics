## Week 4: Selection, etc. (Part 2)

### 102 - Peter Principle
In hierarchical organizations individuals tend to be promoted to their level of incompetence.

From satirical book "peter Principle" by Laurence Peters.

Good at each level until too high, then you have substandard performance and must:
- demote
- redesign job
- terminate

_*Can occur when you promote Best Operator_

What's the point?  Avoid it.  If it happens, deal with it.  

### 81 - Mobility Circle
Job Competence leads to Job Mobility which leads to Competence which leads to Mobility.

- mobility through competence
- promotion through the ranks

What's the point?  As a manager, you want to know someone is competent to get to the next level and if not, it's your job to build their KASH.

### 42 - Evaluation Fusion Triangle
Three bases used for evaluating people.

1. Traits
  - used to doing this
  - subjective
  - complex - what mix is needed
2. Activities
  - info needed for coaching
  - difficult to determine true cause and effect
  - working on the right thing
  - timing and technique
3. Results
  - bottom line measurement (did you achieve the results you set out to achieve?)
  - cause and effect
  - bad activities can get results

What's the point? Use all three!  

### 4 - Activity Avoidance
The use of low priority activity to avoid high priority activity.

What's the point?  Don't do this.  Put your energy toward the right things.  In the context of evaluation, be aware of this.  

### 5 - Algebraic Results
Organizational results are the composite of contributions, both plus and minus.

What's the point?  Give feedback that recognizes the good work _and_ the opportunities to improve.  Recognize that performance is the product of positives and negatives.  

### 150 - X is Good
When people make evaluative statements, they usually treat it as fact, but without proof, others treat them as opinion.

'X' is a person or thing being evaluated.
'Good' is an evaluative statement.

What's the point?  You need to backup your statements with facts.

### 49 - Good Subordinate
A subordinate who is judged as good by his or her superior.

'Good' is a summary conclusion by manager.

Creates a communications gap:
- performance reviews
- job placement
- promotion

What's the point?

### 27 - Connoisseur Effect
Managers evaluation judgements are influenced by "best observed or best experienced" as their evaluation standard.

What is a connoisseur?  
- An expert in subject matter.  
- Someone with huge breadth of experience.  
- Tasted both the worst and the best wine.  As a result, they can pass judgement, make recommendations, pair it with food, etc.
- High KASH

What's the point?  What you've seen and/or experienced is your bar, the level you will consider "best."

### 57 - Indispensable person
The person the organization cannot afford to lose.

How does it happen?
- hard worker who can and does get the job done
- job becomes bigger than anyone you can find
- job specialization
- lack of cross training

Problems:
- management loses control
- cannot lose

Example:
- Steve Jobs

### 25 - Compensation Scale
Foundation principle of compensation in the free enterprise system is that compensation equals contribution.

5 R's

Reference
Factor
Market
Place

Responsibility
Results
Reward

What's the point?  As a manager, how do you influence the compensation/contribution system?  Selection: Specify skills, experience, requirements for the specific grade.

### 24 - Compensation Fusion Triangle
Three factors which must be considered in developing a compensation program.

- Internal Equity
  - ranking of job in organization
  - fair not equal
- Job Performance
  - individual performance
  - in job
  - in salary grade
- External Equity
  - competitive within market
  - salary surveys
  - creates minimum, maximum, midpoint

What's the point? Establishes pay grades, ranges, and actual pay.
