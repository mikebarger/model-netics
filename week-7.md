## Week 7: Motivation

Can managers motivate?  According to modelnetics, no.

Where does motivation come from?  Within.

### 36 - Desire for Change
Three-word definition for motivation.

Current state versus your goals.

What you have today versus what you desire.

The motivation gap:
- illustrates that you are motivated by your wants/needs.
- the difference between where you are and where you want to be.

The motivation gap:
- is not equal to action.
- as it closes, motivation fades.



### 83 - Motivation-Dissatisfaction
Dissatisfaction is the seed of Motivation

- dissatisfaction with your current circumstance
- motivation arises from dissatisfaction
- cause (dissatisfaction) > effect (motivation)



### 12 - Attitude Stair-steps
Action to bring about a change results from a series of attitudinal changes.

awareness (of a better way) ^ understanding (more info current situation/future possibilities) ^ concern (leads to dissatisfaction) ^ dissatisfaction (increases level of intensity) ^ action (to change)



### 11 - Attitude Box
Response to a given stimulus is highly dependent on our attitude - and attitude is based upon prior experience and work environments.

#### Attitude Box (model)
- stimulus
- response
- prior experience
- work environment

Job as manager: create an environment that provides change (starts with dissatisfaction).  i.e. North Wind (create a desire for change)

What's the point? You can't influence past work experience but you _can_ influence work environment.  Do that.



### 14 - Behavior is Goal Directed
Human behavior is directed towards the accomplishment of goals.

- Individual, personal goals matter most <- why it's important that personnel goals align with organizational goals
- If you can understand an individual's goals, you can understand their behavior

#### Characteristics of Goals
- personal:
  - internal
  - motivation gap
  - based on stimulus fraction
- sensible:
  - to the individual
  - not to us
- multiple and conflicting:
  - complex

What's the point?  If you can understand an individual's goals, you can understand their behavior.



### 124 - Seven Ports of Life
Seven areas where people spend their time

1. Job
2. Family
3. Religion
4. Civic
5. Health
6. Recreation
7. Self-Development

Each item above is a port > spend time in each.

Constraints:
- only 24 hours in a day
- trade-offs between ports
- sacrifice in some ports

Solutions: multi-port, self-development



### 8 - Anxiety Streams
Three principle sources of anxieties

What is anxiety?
- worry
- fear
- stress

#### Principles
1. Guilt feelings:
  - if we do not accomplish a goal, we feel failure
  - if we do accomplish a goal, what is next
2. Concept of death:
  - increases with age
  - acceptance of reality
    - what is it
    - when will it come
    - may not accomplish everything
    - mid-life crisis
3. Sense of purpose:
  - increases with age
  - a well-defined sense of purpose reduces anxiety

What's the point?  Your job as manager is to connect the dots.  People need a sense of purpose.



### 84 - Motivation Stair Steps
Motivation stems from a desire to satisfy a need, and people will give higher priority to the more basic needs before proceeding to the satisfaction of higher needs.

physicial (food, clothing, shelter) ^ security (safety, ongoing physical needs) ^ social (need to belong) ^ esteem (self-esteem, of others) ^ self-actualization



### Motivation Triangle
Three-level, two-factor approach to motivation

- anxiety > security
- boredom > stimulation
- anonymity > identity
