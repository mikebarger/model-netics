## Week 3: Selection, etc.
Most of what a manager does stems from hiring decisions.

#### What is Selection?
- Hiring or delegating someone for a job

#### Why is it important?
- Increase morale, efficiency
- Skill has to meet the need
- Culture fit

### 117 - Recruiting Diamond
The four steps in recruitment
1. Picture
  - Ideal person
  - Needed KASH
2. Locate
  - who
  - where
  - how
3. Compare
  - to Picture
  - to other candidates
4. Sell
  - do not oversell or mislead

*First zero base:*
- job
- level
- timing

What's the point?  DO THIS.  Do your homework, make sure you've got the right people.

### 60 - Job Fusion Triangle
Three pinciple forces that impact a job.

1. Person
  - KASH
  - what do they bring?
2. Others
  - A's, B's
  - peers
  - customers
  - family
3. Situation
  - resources
  - time
  - environment
  - budget

What's the point?  Be aware that all 3 of these are important in selection.

### 54 - Identification
Primary job of a manager is to identify those individuals who _can and will_ get the job done within the resource constraints and the context of the job.

- Can = competance
- Will = motivation

#### Key Points
- initial selection
- ongoing selection
- continuous process

### 61 - Job Match Diagram
Relationship or match between an individual and the job.

#### Want to look at:
- size of gap
- status of gap:
  - is it moving
  - in what direction
  - why
#### Normal situation:
- comparison
  - is job bigger than the person

What's the point?  Is the gap getting bigger or smaller?

### 59 - Interview Pentagon
Five part interview guide: job, self/person, others, company, compensation

1. Job
  - past, present, future
2. Person
  - education
  - self-development
  - goals
  - outside activities
3. Others
  - coworkers
  - boss
  - like to work with...
  - superiors, subordinates, peers
4. Company
  - attitude
  - culture preferred
5. Compensation
  - cover last
  - compensation = contribution
  - expectations

What's the point?  Be prepared.  Need a plan.  Don't use resume as interview guide.  Also, Modelnetics is dead wrong - compensation should be first.

### 29 - Criticial Incident Procedure
Past experiences and incidents are the best predictor of future success.

#### Developed by Dr. John Flanagan

#### Two questions:
- what did you do?
- why did you do it?

#### Use in:
- selection interviews
- performance evaluations

#### STAR
Situation, Task, Action, Result

What's the point?  Use this.  It's an effective technique

### 44 - Failure Avoidance Selection
Selection based on things you do not want - based on standards and procedures designed to avoid failures

#### Failure Avoidance
- may start at termination
- list of past failures
- establishes minimum standards

#### List of things you want to avoid
- not enough experience
- not enough education
- wrong degree, wrong school

What's the point?  DON'T DO THIS.

### 136 - Success Oriented Selection
Selection based on things you do want based on standards and procedures designed to achieve success

#### Achieve Success
- primary skills
  - what does it take?
  - proven track record
- interpersonal skills
  - different levels for different positions

#### List of things you want
- 5+ years of experience
- minimum degree requirements
- etc.

What's the point?  DO THIS.
