# Model-netics

_*Week 5 was Jeopardy-style review._

## Week 6: Delegation

For model-netics, think like this: As a manager... what do you delegate?

1. Why is delegation important?  Get things done
2. Management Definition: The accomplishment of predetermined objectives through others

### 94 - Organizing Pie
Method of Organizing work.
Delegators select what work they should do before delegating.

- the smaller the wedge, the greater the span of control
- the greater the span of control, the smaller the wedge
- slices must be cut cleanly

What's the point?

### 33 - Define to Delegate
Definition is necessary in delegation.
You cannot delegate what you cannot define.
Delegation without definition is abdication.

- expectations, outcomes, etc.
- it's the employee's job to know _how_, you are concerned with the _what_ (the result)

What's the point?

### 34 - Delegation Cyber-Chart
A decision

1. Communication: Define the expected results
2. Competence: Can you do this?  If they cannot do it, build their KASH
3. Motivation: Will or Will Not
4. Results: Right/Wrong, feedback
5. Info System: Automatic or Not Automatic

What's the point? Follow this and understand that it can break down at any point.  As a manager, you should do this *every* time.

### 18 - Can you?  Will you?
Two critical questions managers and staff ask about each other.
_relative to the ability of each other to help them reach their goals_

- Can you?  Competence
- Will you?  Motiviation

What's the point? Know your B's.  You their competencies, motivations, and goals are so you can help them reach them.

### 35 - Delegation Triangle
The operating relationships between a manager "A" and subordinate "B"

TOP: Do
MID: Do & Report
BOT: Check, Do, & Report

^You move closer to the top as your trust grows with your manager and vice versa.

What's the point?

### 151 - Yes Concept (a.k.a. the "Yes Man")
Organizational effectiveness and efficiency are positively influenced when personnel are in general agreement with the strategy and tactics of the organization.

Need at least 80% agreement rate (yes=yes, no=no)

What's the point?  Say what you mean.  Want honesty and trust so you can rotate the Delegation Triangle.

### 9 - Army Game
a Game a "B" may play where they do what they are told to do

Manager's effectiveness is limited by two kinds of people:
- those who _will not_ do as they are told
- those whol _only do_ as they are told

For managers:
- hard to define everything in a job
- cannot tell a subordinate everything to do
- hard to hold employee responsible

What's the point?

### 13 - Authority Syndrome
"Lack of Authority" is used as an excuse for lack of performance

What's the point?

### 134 - Suboptimization
Situation where sub-unit or individual objectives are given priority over unit objectives

A sub-unit is any organizational unit except for the entire organization

Individual > Department > Division > Company

What's the point? Everything you delegate should be in context to broad organizational goals

### 66 - Mack Truck Theory (a.k.a. hit by a bus theory)
Operating theory that A or B may be lost to the organization at any time

Don't let the Indispensible Person occur.

What's the point?  You should operate in this way.

### 142 - Tomato Plant Problem
Overload situation that exists when individuals have more duties and responsibilities than time and resources available

The problem: 5 tomato plants (duties and responsibilities), water for 3 (time available)

What's the point?

### 82 - More Time Cyber-Chart
Four step program for solving the managers need for more time.

1. Spend more time
  - On and off the job
2. Simplify work
3. Pre-delegation analysis
4. Delegation
