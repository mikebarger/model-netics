## Week 8: Motivation 2

### 36 - Self-fulfilling Prophecy
A person's behavior is influenced by their perception of how other people view them

What is a prophecy?  A prediction of something to come.

Rats and Psychology Students: Divide rats into two groups, call one group dumb and the other smart, then let students (thinking one group is really dumb and the other smart) train them to run a maze.  The rats perform as well as their students expect them to.  Thus, the "smart" group performs better.

I am not what I think I am.  I am not what you think I am.  I am what I think you think I am.

What's the point?  Treat people the way you want them to be.

### 26 - Confidence Circle
Circular relationship between confidence and accomplishment

Confidence/Accomplishment

Confidence is usually spiraling up or down.
New employees work off of a manager's confidence.

As you accomplish more tasks successfully, you get more confidence.

What's the point?  As a manager, help people be successful because it generates confidence, which generates more success.

### 55 - Improvement Diagram
Two approaches to influence the desire for improvement: Leadership and Standards

Pull -> LEADERSHIP <- Success Oriented
Push -> STANDARDS <- Failure Avoidance

What's the point?  You need both approaches.

### 1 - Acres of Diamonds
First place to look for a better opportunity is in your present situation

Russell Conwell:
- famous clergyman
- earned $5 million as a speaker
- sent poor boys to Temple University

Told a story of Ali Hafed:
- successful and wealthy Persian farmer
- heard of diamonds
- sold his farm and left his family
- started a quest to find diamonds
- spent his whole life searching
- died broke and homeless

What's the point?  Understand your people's goals and behaviors and understand what might lead them to pursue opportunities elsewhere.

### 119 - Rising Expectations
Our expectations always seem to out-distance our realizations or achievements.  This bias seems to apply without regard to absolute levels of achievements.

It causes dissatisfaction.

### 118 - Relative Deprivation
Individuals will feel deprived when they perceive actual situations less than their standard

This is dysfunctional.

Feelings of deprivation are relative:
- standard higher than actual
- individual feels unfairness

How it happens:
- others get something they want
- others get something they feel they deserved
- past:
  - lose something they had
  - did not get something they felt they should have
- future:
  - rising expectations
  - do not get something they felt they deserved (i.e. entitlement)

### 120 - Roles and Goals
There is an inevitable dualism between roles and goals.  One of the most critical decisions in life is which one will dominate.

Seven ports of life:
- ports are the goals
- spokes in the diagram are the roles you play to acheive a goal

3-way conflict:
- goal versus goal (trade-offs)
- role versus role (role dissonance)
- goals versus roles

What's the point? You need to consciously decide what is going to dominate and where the trade-offs are.

### 92 - Opportunity Wedge
Life is like a wedge - characterized by closing horizons and lost opportunities.

Examples:
- School choices
- career choices
- family choices
- geographical locations to live

So What?
- value received from recovering a lost opportunity may not be worth the cost
- awareness
- planning
- selection

What's the point?  Figure out who people are and what's important to them so that you can make the best use of your and their time.

### Two Triangles
There are two tragedies associated with goals:

1. not to reach them (failure)
2. to reach them (no more motivation, death of desire)

What's the point?  Keep setting goals and reaching them.
